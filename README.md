# reactiongame
Nucleo L4A6ZG an interactive memory and reaction game where players can try to repeat a growing sequence of colored lights by pressing matching buttons.

# system architecture 
1. LEDs and Buttons are paired and used as the main game interface. Each LED lights up in a pattern
generated by the microcontroller, and players must press the matching button to repeat the
sequence. The LEDs and buttons communicate directly with the STM32 through GPIO pins.

2. Servos are controlled by PWM signals from the STM32. When the player enters an incorrect
sequence, both servos activate to shake the platform as feedback. Each servo receives 5V power
from the main supply and control signals from the MCU.

3. LCD Display shows game information such as the current score, messages, and level progress. It
connects to the STM32 using a 4-bit interface and operates at 3.3V logic.

4. UART / PC Terminal connection links the STM32 to a PC terminal. This connection displays the
leaderboard, logs game data, and allows for serial communication during testing and debugging.
STM32L4A6ZG (MCU) The MCU serves as the central controller for all modules. It powers the
LEDs, buttons, LCD, and servos, while also managing timing, game logic, and serial communication.
It runs on 3.3V logic from a regulated 5V USB supply.

5. Power Supply (5V USB Source) The 5V USB-B port from the Nucleo board provides all system
power. The board’s regulator steps this down to 3.3V for logic components, while the servos draw
directly from the 5V line.
